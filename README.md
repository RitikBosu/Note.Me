Hi, I'm Ritik
ðŸš€ I have developed a MERN Stack project. The experience of applying theoretical knowledge into practical application has been immensely rewarding.
Developed a full-stack Notes application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app allows users to create, edit, delete, and view notes securely.
Tech: MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, JWT, bcrypt, Mongoose, Git,  Netlify, MongoDB Atlas
Key Highlights:
â€¢	Frontend: React.js for building dynamic UI components for managing notes.
â€¢	Backend: Node.js & Express for handling API routes and CRUD operations for notes.
â€¢	Security: Implemented JWT for user authentication and bcrypt for secure password storage.
â€¢	Deployment: Deployed backend on Heroku, frontend on Netlify, and database on MongoDB Atlas.
